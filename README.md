# Data_Cleaning_Pipeline

The use of Machine Learning Algorithms is not required for every dataset, but every dataset does require some data cleaning steps. So, building a data cleaning pipeline using Pandas is one of those bread-and-butter tasks every Data Scientist should master early on.

# Data Cleaning Pipeline using Pandas

So, even though not all datasets require machine learning, every dataset does demand proper cleaning, and this pipeline sets the foundation for accurate, reliable analysis and modelling.
